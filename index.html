      A <strong>spice</strong> is a seed, fruit,
      root, bark, or other plant substance
      primarily used for
      <em>flavoring or coloring food.</em>
      Spices are sometimes used in medicine,
      religious rituals, cosmetics or perfume
      production. For example, vanilla is commonly
      used as an ingredient in fragrance
      manufacturing.
    </p>

      A spice may be available in several forms:
      fresh, whole dried, or pre-ground dried.
      Generally, spices are dried. Spices may be
      ground into a powder for convenience. A
      whole dried spice has the longest shelf
      life, so it can be purchased and stored in
      larger amounts, making it cheaper on a
      per-serving basis.
